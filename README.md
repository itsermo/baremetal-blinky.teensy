# Teensy 4.0 Bare-Metal C++ Example

This is a bare-metal example for the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) 4.0 board. It's intended to be used with the free GCC ARM toolchain.

It contains support for C++17 STL and fast assmebly implementations of essential `memset()` and `memcpy()` functions.
